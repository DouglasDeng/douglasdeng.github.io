*This is an example of Quick plot python code in R. This particular example uses two python code chunks*

```{r}
library(reticulate) 
py_install ("numpy")
py_install("matplotlib")
py_install("pandas")

library(reticulate)
matplotlib <- import("matplotlib")
matplotlib$use("Agg", force = TRUE) 


```

```{python}
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

x=np.random.normal(50,10,100)
y=np.random.normal(50,10,100)

plt.scatter(x,y)

```

*The numpy stack was used to generate random numbers and the Matplotlib stack was used to help create the scatter plot. First, the numpy function creates 100 random numbers from a normal distribution with a mean of 50 and a standard deviation of 10. These random draws were both set equal to variables x and y."plt.scatter" created a scatterplot between variables x and y. This plot can be similarly created in ggplot.*

## Reticulation

*We can do the same thing by isntead defining x ("x2") in R rather than python.*

```{r}
x2<- rnorm(100, mean=50, sd=10)
```

```{python}
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

y2=np.random.normal(50,10,100)

plt.scatter(r.x2,y2)

```
*The following code communicated x2 defined in R to be used in the python matplotlib scatter plot. This was denoted using r. to label the R-defined variable "x2".*

This is the lecture material I referenced to produce my code. Cheers!
